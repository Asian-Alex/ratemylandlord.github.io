### Setup Instructions ###
1. Hopefully everyone already has a linux command line (ex: WSL if you're in Windows, because idk Command Prompt lol)
2. [Clone the repo](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/creating-and-managing-repositories/cloning-a-repository#cloning-a-repository)
3. cd into the cloned `ratemylandlord` folder
4. check Python installed by running `pip`, otherwise install python version ~3.6.5
5. `pip install -r requirements.txt` , this should replace manually doing: 
5.1 `pip install django djangorestframework factory_boy`
6. cd into the `rate_my_landlord` directory
7. `python manage.py runserver`
8. follow given url to localhost, where you should see the site!
8.5 Check the `ratemylandlord/rate_my_landlord/api/urls.py` file for subpages. Right now for example you have to add '/home' at the end of the localhost url to see the LandlordView.

### Additional Recommended Setup for Development ###
1. I think it's best to develop on VSCode! It has helpful extensions and is connected to Git
2. download the Prettier, Python, Django, React, Javascript extensions which are helpful for linting, consistent code styling, and debugging

### Dev Instructions ###
1. Before making changes, make sure you have done `git pull origin main` to make sure you have the latest changes

 ### When Making Database Changes / Models.py Changes ###
1. `python manage.py makemigrations`
2. `python manage.py migrate`
